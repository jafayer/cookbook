# Cookbook

⚠️ This is not a production-ready site, deploy at your own risk. The auth for the site is very self-rolled, and I've taken no care to mitigate common security concerns such as CSRF. ⚠️

I've wanted a way to write and store recipes in Cooklang format in a shareable website format. It occurred to me to try to do this statically, but I want the authoring experience to be a little bit more friendly than needing to commit a .cook file to git.

This website is my attempt at creating a pleasant cooklang authoring and rendering experience.

This repo isn't really intended for others to deploy their own instance and especially lacks rudimentary security beyond local password authentication, but you're certainly welcome to if you're interested. Also would be happy to provide support and to fix things up if anyone's interested in using this themselves.
